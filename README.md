## Object Detection

![Result 1](./readme_source/result.gif)

The repository consists of object detection using YOLO on image and video.

In the main repository, we used a manual solution to get the model where we clone darknet repository and compile it. That method provides more flexibility and customization while less automated steps. Also, we first showed the results on the sample images and then on video file.

In the RealTimeWebcam branch, we used a simpler method to get the model where we downloaded using Torch library. Also, the same as before, we first checked out the results on the image data then we used webcam to catch real-time video data for object detection.
